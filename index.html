		<p>Summer is the best season because it's hot! Can work on a tan, go to the beach, take road trips, there seem to be a lot more activities (particularly outdoors) during the summertime!</p>
		<p>If you get too hot in the summer, you can easily take off layers or jump into a pool or cold shower for relief. Summer is also a great time to go out for patio drinks!</p>
		<p>Summer is also the time of year where most people take vacation from school or work, so there's more chances to see people you are close to.</p>
