		<p>Fall is the best season for many reasons. For one, the weather is just right. Not too hot, not too cool.<br>It's the peerfect sweater weather! Another great thing about fall is all the leaves changing colour.<br>Whether you want to take some nice photos or just enjoy the the scenery, fall is a beautiful season.</p>Fall also houses one the greatest holidays: Halloween. A great time for spooks, thrills, fun costumes, and lots of candy! With all these wonderful things, fall just can't be topped.
